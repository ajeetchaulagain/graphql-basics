## GraphQL Basics

This project is created to demonstrate the graphql concept with Node.

## Tools and Libraries used

- Node is used as Runtime environment
- graphql-yoga is used as a GraphQL Server for Node

## How to Run

Given node and npm is available in the machine, run the following commands

- `git clone https://github.com/ajeetchaulagain/graphql-basics.git`
- `cd graphql-basics`
- `npm i`
- `npm run start` - to run the development server. You can view the Graphql Playground running on http://localhost:4000/ from where you can test the API endpoints

## Note

This project is created to experiment graphql concepts for my own use. So code might change eventually.
